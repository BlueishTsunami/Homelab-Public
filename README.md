# Homelab-Public
**Homelab Docs**

This notebook was created during the setup and implementation of my homelab environment. It is intended to document the process and act as a guide for others attempting to do the same. 
As this was originally intended for personal use, the notes are a bit messy. I have been working to sanitize and make the documents publicly accessible. 

Poke through the directories to get more info. At a high-level: 
- **Hardware**: Summarizations of hardware being used in the env. 
- **General**: Details around general host setup and network config. 
- **Services**: Details around the services running in the lab.
